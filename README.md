Repository

I think **Git** is more like a time machine. Starting a new project, developers set up their "home base," or **repository** either building a new one or acquiring the keys to an existing one. It's like moving into a new house or into a shared living arrangement. 

Cloning a **repository** is like copying a house on your own land, or computer. You can now experiment and alter without thinking about ruining anyone else's space.

Establishing a **branch** rking in your own room you can paint the walls, rearrange furniture, and experiment without compromising the primary living space. You capture (**commits**) of your development as you work, much as you would have pictures of your room's transformation.

You might wish to find out what your housemates have been up to, so you grab their changes; perhaps they have added some lovely living room decorations. You **push** your changes, basically saying "Hey everyone, come check out what I've done!" when you're pleased with how your room now looks.

Sometimes you and a housemate might try to redecorate the same living room corner anyway you choose (**merge** conflict). **Git** throws its hands and says, "Whoa, you two need to talk this out! I'm not sure which version to keep." You will have to choose among changes which stay and which go together.

Like a shared diary of home improvements you can always look back on, this entire system helps everyone work together smoothly and tracks who did what and when.
